most sorting algos are n^2 or nlogn

o(n^2)
selection sort
- non adaptive method
- cycles through list and keeps picking the smallest number

will be on2 no matter

bubble sort
keeps going up in pairs and swapping the pairs
best case n
worst case n2

insertion sort
go through list one by one, insert into new array in order
best case n
worst case n2

 To distinguish bubble sort from insertion sort, use arrays which are
  sorted except that the largest element is at the beginning of the
  array and the smallest element is at the end. Insertion sort will
  be O(n), while bubble sort will be O(n^2).


shellsort (better insertion sort)



not the above
merge sort
always n log n
Given two sorted lists we can merge them easily
▪ Partition out list in two recursively
▪ Sort if list is of size 1 or 2
▪ End recursion merging lists

quick sort
Algorithm:
▪ Pick a number
▪ Put all numbers less on the left
▪ Put all numbers more on the left
▪ Repeat on the smaller intervals until we are at size 1
▪ Best case O(n log n)
▪ Worst case O(n2)

heap sort
nlogn
put in heap
