most sorting algos are n^2 or nlogn

o(n^2)
selection sort
- non adaptive method
- cycles through list and keeps picking the smallest number

will be on2 no matter

bubble sort
keeps going up in pairs and swapping the pairs
best case n
worst case n2

insertion sort
go through list one by one, insert into new array in order
best case n
worst case n2

 To distinguish bubble sort from insertion sort, use arrays which are
  sorted except that the largest element is at the beginning of the
  array and the smallest element is at the end. Insertion sort will
  be O(n), while bubble sort will be O(n^2).


shellsort (better insertion sort)
